# HW3 - Proabilistic ContextFree Grammar

### Task 1
Arthur is the king .
`$P(Arthur|Proper)=1/8$`
`P(is|VerbT)=1/6`


Therefore, this PCFG implements a bigram language model. 

### Task 2
The main difference is that the PCFG that only contains grammar 1 cannot parse most of the sentences. This is because grammar 1 does not have rules such as S1 -> +Misc to parse sentences that begin with a *Misc* word.
